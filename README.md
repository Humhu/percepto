# percepto
Percepto is a neural network library for training and running simple networks in C++. It uses compile-time specification of network architecture to reduce code verbosity. Currently only linear units with a few activation functions are supported. Refer to [this file](https://github.com/Humhu/percepto/blob/master/examples/TestNet.cpp) for a classic perceptron example.
